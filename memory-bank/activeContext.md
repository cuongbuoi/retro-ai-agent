## Current Focus

The current focus of the Retro AI Agent Assistant project is establishing the core functionality and user interface. The main components have been implemented, including:

1. The agent selection interface in the header
2. The chat interface for communication with AI agents
3. Three specialized AI agents (Frontend, Backend, Product Manager)
4. Integration with the Google Gemini API

## Recent Changes

- Implemented the core UI with retro pixel art styling
- Set up the agent selection dropdown
- Created the chat interface with message streaming
- Added three specialized agents with different expertise
- Configured deployment settings for Vercel and Netlify

## Next Steps

The following items are prioritized for upcoming work:

1. **Enhance Chat Experience**:

   - Add typing indicators
   - Implement message history persistence
   - Support for code formatting and syntax highlighting

2. **Agent Improvements**:

   - Refine agent prompts for better responses
   - Add more training examples to improve handling of edge cases
   - Consider adding more specialized agents (DevOps, UX designer, etc.)

3. **UI Enhancements**:

   - Add more retro-themed visual elements
   - Implement responsive design for mobile devices
   - Add animations for message transitions

4. **Technical Improvements**:

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Agent Personalities**: Deciding how distinct each agent's personality should be while maintaining professionalism and helpfulness
2. **Multilingual Support**: Evaluating the effectiveness of Vietnamese language support and potentially adding more languages
3. **Response Quality**: Monitoring and improving the quality of AI responses for technical accuracy and helpfulness
4. **Performance Optimization**: Considering ways to optimize streaming and rendering performance for smooth user experience
5. **User Feedback**: Planning to implement a feedback mechanism to improve agent responses over time

## Current Challenges

1. **API Rate Limits**: Managing Google Gemini API rate limits, especially during development and testing
2. **Response Time**: Optimizing response time while maintaining quality of AI-generated content
3. **Balance of Personality vs. Utility**: Finding the right balance between agent personality and technical utility
4. **Edge Cases**: Handling various edge cases in user queries and agent responses
5. **Testing Strategy**: Developing an effective testing strategy for AI-driven applications
