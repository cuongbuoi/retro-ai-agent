# Active Context

## Current Focus

We are enhancing the chat application's capabilities by adding file upload and analysis functionality while also improving the Vietnamese localization. This allows users to share files with the AI assistant for analysis and interpretation, expanding the usefulness of the application beyond text-based interactions.

The main components have been implemented, including:

1. The agent selection interface in the header
2. The chat interface for communication with AI agents
3. Three specialized AI agents (Frontend, Backend, Product Manager)
4. Integration with the Google Gemini API
5. File upload and analysis support

## Recent Changes

- Implemented the core UI with retro pixel art styling
- Set up the agent selection dropdown
- Created the chat interface with message streaming
- Added three specialized agents with different expertise
- Configured deployment settings for Vercel and Netlify
- Implemented file upload functionality in the chat interface
- Added support for processing images, text files, and PDFs
- Modified API handling to process file content along with text messages
- Updated UI to include file upload button and file display in chat bubbles
- Added file processing indicators to improve user experience
- Fixed UI layout issues with file uploads:
  - Fixed issue where file uploads would push the input box off-screen
  - Made the chat footer sticky to ensure it stays visible
  - Improved scrolling behavior to accommodate file attachments
  - Ensured proper responsive layout on various screen sizes
- Enhanced Vietnamese localization:
  - Changed "Trò chuyện cùng" to "Tán gẫu cùng" in the chat header
  - Renamed the user persona from "You" to "Thằng Bảy"
  - Translated UI elements for file uploads and processing status
  - Updated typing indicators to use Vietnamese language patterns
  - Added Vietnamese label for agent selection
  - Improved UI styling for better Vietnamese text display

## Next Steps

The following items are prioritized for upcoming work:

1. **Enhance Chat Experience**:

   - Add typing indicators
   - Implement message history persistence
   - Support for code formatting and syntax highlighting
   - Complete Vietnamese localization across all UI elements

2. **Agent Improvements**:

   - Refine agent prompts for better responses
   - Add more training examples to improve handling of edge cases
   - Consider adding more specialized agents (DevOps, UX designer, etc.)

3. **UI Enhancements**:

   - Add more retro-themed visual elements
   - Implement responsive design for mobile devices
   - Add animations for message transitions

4. **Technical Improvements**:

   - Implement caching to reduce API calls
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Set up unit and integration tests

5. **File Upload Improvements**:
   - Add file size limitations to prevent performance issues
   - Implement more robust error handling for failed uploads
   - Optimize file processing for large files
   - Add support for more file formats

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Agent Personalities**: Deciding how distinct each agent's personality should be while maintaining professionalism and helpfulness
2. **Multilingual Support**: Enhancing Vietnamese language support with colloquial terms and natural expressions
3. **Response Quality**: Monitoring and improving the quality of AI responses for technical accuracy and helpfulness
4. **Performance Optimization**: Considering ways to optimize streaming and rendering performance for smooth user experience
5. **User Feedback**: Planning to implement a feedback mechanism to improve agent responses over time

### Localization Strategy

We're implementing a comprehensive Vietnamese localization approach:

- Using colloquial Vietnamese terms to create a more engaging and authentic experience
- Adapting the interface to match Vietnamese language patterns and expressions
- Maintaining the character and personality of the assistant (Đạt Văn Tây) in Vietnamese context
- Creating consistent terminology across the application

### File Handling Strategy

We're using a client-side approach to file handling:

- Files are read and converted to appropriate formats (base64 for images, text for documents)
- File contents are sent along with the message to the AI service
- The Gemini API processes both text content and file data in the same request

This approach minimizes server load since files are processed on the client side before being sent to the API. However, it does increase the payload size for API requests, which could impact performance for very large files.

### UX Considerations

- Added file attachment previews in chat bubbles to provide visual confirmation
- Implemented loading indicators during file processing to keep users informed
- Maintained the retro pixel styling for all new UI elements
- Made sure file attachment interface is intuitive and consistent with the existing design
- Fixed layout issues to ensure the interface is always usable regardless of file upload status
- Enhanced button and UI element sizes for better usability
- Used culturally appropriate Vietnamese phrases and expressions

### Technical Debt

Current implementation has some limitations:

- Very large files might cause performance issues
- Limited error handling for failed uploads or incompatible files
- File processing is synchronous and might block the UI thread for large files
- No current limitation on file size or number of attachments
- Incomplete Vietnamese localization in some dynamic content sections

These issues will be addressed in future iterations as we continue to develop and refine the application.

## Current Challenges

1. **API Rate Limits**: Managing Google Gemini API rate limits, especially during development and testing
2. **Response Time**: Optimizing response time while maintaining quality of AI-generated content
3. **Balance of Personality vs. Utility**: Finding the right balance between agent personality and technical utility
4. **Edge Cases**: Handling various edge cases in user queries and agent responses
5. **Testing Strategy**: Developing an effective testing strategy for AI-driven applications
6. **Cultural Adaptation**: Ensuring the Vietnamese version maintains cultural relevance and natural language patterns
